# Overview

I recently developed an expense tracker application using React, a modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of React and enhance my skills as a software engineer. The expense tracker app allows users to manage their financial transactions effectively by tracking both income and expenses.

The expense tracker app features a clean and intuitive user interface, providing users with a straightforward platform to record and categorize their financial activities. Users can add transactions, specifying the amount, category (income or expense), and a brief description. The app then calculates and displays the total income, total expenses, and the overall balance in real-time.

To create a responsive and interactive user experience, I leveraged React components to modularize the application's structure. The state management in React ensures that the user interface updates dynamically as transactions are added or removed. Additionally, the app utilizes React Hooks, such as useState and useContext, to manage the application's state and handle context-specific functionalities.

The application also incorporates a global state management approach using the Context API, allowing different components to access and update the application state without prop drilling. This not only enhances the app's scalability but also provides a more maintainable codebase.

As a software engineer, my primary purpose in developing this expense tracker app was to reinforce my knowledge of React concepts and best practices. By working on a real-world project, I aimed to gain hands-on experience in state management, component composition, and the effective use of React Hooks. Additionally, I wanted to explore the implementation of a global state management solution using the Context API.

Through this project, I strived to improve my skills in building responsive and dynamic user interfaces, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of the React ecosystem. The expense tracker app serves not only as a practical tool for personal finance management but also as a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and improvement as a software engineer.

# Development Environment

Code Editor (Visual Studio Code):

I utilized Visual Studio Code as my primary code editor. Its rich set of features, extensions, and integrated terminal made the development process more efficient.
Version Control (Git and GitHub):

Git was employed for version control to track changes in the codebase. GitHub served as a remote repository, providing collaboration capabilities and version history.
Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager):

Node.js was used for running JavaScript on the server side, and npm facilitated package management. These tools were crucial for managing project dependencies and running scripts.

I used React as my framework so that means I had to incorprate Javascript
